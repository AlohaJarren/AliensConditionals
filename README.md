# AliensConditionals

1) Aliens are invading! There are blue, green, and red aliens. <br />

2) The total amount of aliens there are is 10,000. <br />

3) Create variables with this information, and set up a series of conditional statements such that: <br /> <br />

 - First, check if there are 10,000 aliens. <br />

 - Then, if there are more than 5,000 green aliens, console.log "MOTHER OF GOD, not the green ones" <br />

 - If there are more than a total of 8,000 green and red aliens combined, console.log "DOOOOOM" <br />

 - If there are not more than 3000 red and blue aliens combined, console.log <br />

 - "We will not go quietly into the night. We will not vanish without a fight. TODAY WE CELEBRATE OUR INDEPENDANCE DAY!" <br />

 - You may assign the alien amounts yourself, but the total must add up to ten thousand! <br />
